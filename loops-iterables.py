# Lambdas
'''
## A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
## The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function. Say you have a function definition 
## that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
